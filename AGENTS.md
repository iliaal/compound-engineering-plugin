# Agent Instructions

This repository contains a Bun/TypeScript CLI that converts Claude Code plugins into OpenCode and Codex formats.

## Working Agreement

- **Safety:** Do not delete or overwrite user data. Avoid destructive commands.
- **Testing:** Run `bun test` after changes that affect parsing, conversion, or output.
- **ASCII-first:** Use ASCII unless the file already contains Unicode.
