# Troubleshooting & Technical Details

## Troubleshooting

### "Worktree already exists"

If you see this, the script will ask if you want to switch to it instead.

### "Cannot remove worktree: it is the current worktree"

Switch out of the worktree first (to main repo), then cleanup:

```bash
cd $(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/git-worktree/scripts/worktree-manager.sh cleanup
```

### Lost in a worktree?

See where you are:

```bash
bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/git-worktree/scripts/worktree-manager.sh list
```

### .env files missing in worktree?

If a worktree was created without .env files (e.g., via raw `git worktree add`), copy them:

```bash
bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/git-worktree/scripts/worktree-manager.sh copy-env feature-name
```

Navigate back to main:

```bash
cd $(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
```

### Directory Structure

```
.worktrees/
├── feature-login/          # Worktree 1
│   ├── .git
│   ├── app/
│   └── ...
├── feature-notifications/  # Worktree 2
│   ├── .git
│   ├── app/
│   └── ...
└── ...

.gitignore (updated to include .worktrees)
```

### How It Works

- Uses `git worktree add` for isolated environments
- Each worktree has its own branch
- Changes in one worktree don't affect others
- Share git history with main repo
- Can push from any worktree

### Performance

- Worktrees are lightweight (just file system links)
- No repository duplication
- Shared git objects for efficiency
- Much faster than cloning or stashing/switching
