  Capture solved problems as categorized documentation with YAML frontmatter

# compound-docs Skill

Automatically document solved problems to build searchable institutional knowledge with category-based organization (enum-validated problem types).

Single-file architecture -- each problem documented as one markdown file in its symptom category directory (e.g., `docs/solutions/performance-issues/n-plus-one-briefs.md`). Files use YAML frontmatter for metadata and searchability.

## Process

Follow the 7-step documentation capture process. For full details, see [documentation-process.md](./references/documentation-process.md).

1. **Detect confirmation** -- Auto-invoke after "that worked", "it's fixed", etc. Skip trivial fixes.
2. **Gather context** -- Extract module, symptom, investigation attempts, root cause, solution, prevention. BLOCK if critical context missing.
3. **Check existing docs** -- Search `docs/solutions/` for similar issues. If found, offer: new doc with cross-reference, update existing, or other.
4. **Generate filename** -- Format: `[sanitized-symptom]-[module]-[YYYYMMDD].md`
5. **Validate YAML** -- Run [validate-frontmatter.sh](./scripts/validate-frontmatter.sh) against the file. BLOCK until valid.
6. **Create documentation** -- Write file to `docs/solutions/[category]/[filename].md` using [resolution-template.md](./assets/resolution-template.md).
7. **Cross-reference** -- Link related issues. Detect critical patterns (3+ similar issues).

---

## Decision Menu

After successful documentation, present and WAIT for user response:

```
Solution documented

File created:
- docs/solutions/[category]/[filename].md

What's next?
1. Continue workflow (recommended)
2. Add to Required Reading - Promote to critical patterns
3. Link related issues - Connect to similar problems
4. Add to existing skill - Add to a learning skill
5. Create new skill - Extract into new learning skill
6. View documentation - See what was captured
7. Other
```

For detailed response handling, see [documentation-process.md](./references/documentation-process.md).

## Integration Points

**Invoked by:** `/compound` command, manual invocation after solution confirmed, or auto-triggered by confirmation phrases.

**Invokes:** None (terminal skill -- does not delegate to other skills).

**Handoff:** All context needed should be present in conversation history before invocation.

## Success Criteria

- YAML frontmatter validated (all required fields, correct formats)
- File created in `docs/solutions/[category]/[filename].md`
- Enum values match schema exactly
- Code examples included in solution section
- Cross-references added if related issues found
- User presented with decision menu and action confirmed
