## Hooks

| Hook | Event | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `inject-skills` | PreToolUse (Task) | Injects relevant skill instructions into subagent prompts |

When the main agent spawns a subagent via the Task tool, this hook analyzes the subagent's prompt and identifies matching skills based on trigger keywords. It prepends "Read these SKILL.md files" instructions to the prompt so subagents follow the same methodology as the main agent.

Skills are matched using a 3-tier priority system:
1. **Methodology** (planning, debugging, code-review, etc.) — process skills, matched first
2. **Domain** (php-laravel, react-frontend, terraform, etc.) — language/framework skills
3. **Supporting** (writing, md-docs, reflect, etc.) — workflow skills

Up to 5 matching skills are injected per subagent call, prioritized by tier. Subagent types without file read access (e.g., Bash) are skipped.

## MCP Servers

| Server | Description |

| `docfork` | Framework and library documentation lookup via Docfork |

### Docfork

**Tools provided:**
- `query_docs` - Search documentation for a framework/library

9,000+ libraries with daily updates. Free tier: 1,000 requests/month.

MCP servers start automatically when the plugin is enabled.

## Installation

```bash
claude /plugin install compound-engineering
```

## Known Issues

### MCP Server Setup

**Issue:** The bundled Docfork MCP server may not load automatically when the plugin is installed.

**Setup:** Add to your project's `.claude/settings.json` (or `~/.claude/settings.json` for all projects):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "docfork": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://mcp.docfork.com/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

No API key required. Free tier includes 1,000 requests/month.
